# CurrentNews
News app that uses NewsApi to get the latest news from the best news agencies, such as ABC News, FOX News and so on.

## Getting Started
To run this app you need to get [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/) key. I have taken this step in order to bypass limited access to daily requests. Don't worry, getting a key would take just a few seconds :)

#### Setup API key
 1. Visit newsapi.org(https://newsapi.org/) to get your API Key
 2. Copy your API Key from accounts section
 3. Go to NewsApi interface and change my key with yours.
